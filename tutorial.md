# Step 1: Design your Circuit Board

Open up KiCad and create a new project and name it whatever you want! In my case, I named it bluetext.

Select schematic editor - this is where we are laying out all our components.

Before we do anything, we want to import our symbol and footprint libraries for our components. We can either make them ourselves, or find a library online and that's exactly what we're going to do for both!

To import the library


# Step 2: Route your PCB

# Step 3: Firmware

# Step 4: Designing your case (Optional)
